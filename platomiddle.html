     <p>Plato’s Middle Period starts a new stage of development for his philosophical work. It is in the Middle Period that we see Plato (or Plato as Socrates) really begin to strike out into bold new philosophical territory, putting forward his own ideas in response to the questions we have been mulling over since the Early Period. It is also in this period that we see the first articulation of ideas which will become core to Plato’s thinking, such as the immortality of the soul and the Theory of Forms.</p>

    <h3>Big Questions: What is Rhetoric?</h3>
    <p>Socrates appears at the end of a presentation given by a famous sophist named Gorgias. Gorgias is more tempered in his self-advertisement than other sophists; he restricts his expertise to teaching the art of rhetoric rather than virtue itself. Despite this, Gorgias still makes grand claims about the power of oratory, including the ability to make any speaker sound more persuasive than an expert in any given field. Naturally, Socrates seeks to test out Gorgias’ knowledge, ultimately forcing him to admit that a truly skilled orator must possess true knowledge on a given subject rather than just merely speaking persuasively - thus rendering the study of rhetoric moot. After Gorgias comes a hot-headed young man named Polus, who claims that rhetoric is an art which offers one the power to do whatever one pleases, from gaining favors for one’s friends to having one’s enemies executed. It is here that Socrates introduces an important distinction – a pursuit being an art vs. a <i>techne</i>, or 'knack.' Socrates claims that rhetoric is simply a knack for flattery, the same way baking sweets is a knack compared to the art of understanding nutritional health. The conversation turns away from rhetoric to the question of if it is better to practice injustice than suffer it, or vice versa. This part of the debate is taken up by Callicles, an older man who aggressively opposes Socrates’ claim that it is better to suffer injustice than commit it. This leg of the discussion ends in a bitter standoff, culminating in Socrates reciting a myth about the judgement of souls in the afterlife.</p>

    <h3>Big Questions: What is The Nature of Virtue?</h3>
    <p>Meno belongs to a leading aristocratic family in the city of Thessaly, an ally of Athens. Eventually he will pursue an unfortunate military and political career, culminating in his death at the hands of Persia’s king. Here however, he is portrayed as a bright young man still learning about the many virtues he will be expected to uphold in his future social position. The dialogue begins immediately with Meno prodding Socrates to give his opinion on if virtue can be taught. This issue is taken up in other dialogues, but Meno is most remembered for a brief interlude in which the pair deal with another famous problem of learning; the paradox that one cannot inquire about things which one does not already in some way know. It is here that Socrates offers what will be an important theory in later dialogues – the soul is immortal and reincarnates, so at our births we already possess all theoretical knowledge. Socrates demonstrates this by teaching one of Meno’s slaves about geometry, seemingly demonstrating that a person can be made to ‘recollect’ knowledge which they never learned. Though the central question of the discussion is never satisfactorily answered, the contents of Meno lay the groundwork for may ideas that will be developed in later dialogues.</p>

   <h3>Big Questions: What is The Nature of The Soul?</h3>
    <p>One of Plato’s most dramatic dialogues, <i>Phaedo</i> takes place on the eave of Socrates’ execution. With precious few hours left, Socrates is visited a final time by many of his close friends and followers, including ones featured in other dialogues such as Crito and Menexenus. Reported through Phaedo, who was supposedly present, Socrates engages in one last philosophical discussion with Simmias and Cebes on the topic of the soul. Simmias and Cebes offer their doubts about the immortality of the soul, which Socrates refutes. Such refutations include the famous Affinity Argument, in which Socrates marks a distinction between the deathless, pure, higher world of invisible things which the soul belongs to, and the physical, sensible, mortal world of the body. He also further expounds on the theory of Forms, as well as the idea that theoretical knowledge is remembered from past lives. Beyond the interesting theories which are developed in Phaedo, it is in this dialogue above others that we receive a moving image of Socrates as a humble man, deeply committed to the philosophical way of life, even in the face of an unjust death.</p>

        <h2 id="Symposium">Symposium</h2>
    <h3>Big Questions: What is Love?</h3>
    <p>Along with the <i>Republic</i>, <i>Symposium</i> is one of Plato’s best-known masterpieces. The dialogue takes place during a formal drinking party, or ‘symposium,’ to celebrate the young playwright Agathon’s first victorious production. In response to the urging of Phaedrus (who features in the dialogue by the same name) the gathered company take turns giving speeches praising Eros, the god of Love. The group includes others who have been featured in previous dialogues such as Eryximachus and Pausanias, as well as the famous comic playwright Aristophanes. When Socrates’ turn comes, he relates to the party a discussion about love he had with a wise woman named Diatoma (most likely a character invented by Plato). Through Diatoma, Socrates shares his account of the mind’s ascent of Love, starting with love for a particular person and eventually coming to love for the Form of Beauty itself. Shortly after Socrates’ speech concludes, the party is crashed by Alcibiades. In one last speech, Alcibiades drunkenly relates to the company how as a youth he had been one of Socrates’ loving admirers, and how their relationship was a comical inverse of the roles common to pederasty – he passionately pursued Socrates rather than the other way around. The dialogue ends with a final round of drinks until almost everyone leaves or falls asleep, until the next day when Socrates, unfazed by the night of drinking and conversation, makes his exit.</p>

        <h2 id="Republic">Republic</h2>
    <h3>Big Questions: What is Justice?</h3>
    <p>Divided into 10 books, <i>Republic</i> is possibly the most ambitious and influential work in Plato’s entire corpus. Touching on myriad areas of philosophical study, much of Plato’s well-known work is found in the <i>Republic</i>, such as the Allegory of the Cave and the Divided Line. It is in this dialogue that we see Socrates in peak form, actively working on tough philosophical problems and trying to find solutions for them. Broadly, <i>Republic</i> revolves around the question of what Justice is, and whether a fully just person lives a better, happier life than a thoroughly unjust person. In order to examine the question more fully, Socrates proposes to his discussion partners (principally Thrasymachus, Adeimantus, and Glaucon) that the best way to see how an individual’s soul should be ordered is by seeing how an ideal city should be ordered. What follows is Socrates’ view on the nature and purpose of political communities, how said communities are justly organized, and how education should be handled within them. In the end it is decided that only a tightly organized city governed by ‘philosopher kings’ can truly be just. The conversation extends to cover the nature of virtue and vice, and the three parts of the human soul. Then, Socrates eexplains the nature of knowledge through the Theory of Forms; timeless, pure, uniform entities which are only graspable through reason and dialectic. Finally, Socrates ends the conversation with the telling of the Myth of Er, which details the experiences of a man named Er who ventured into the afterlife to report back to the living how souls will be judged and reincarnated after death.</p>

    <h3>Big Questions: What is Rhetoric?</h3>
    <p>On a walk in the country with his friend Phaedrus, Socrates engages him in a conversation about rhetoric and oratory. We see two distinct images of philosophical practice; first brilliant, poetic, and unapologetically rhetorical – and later on, the sober, logical discourse we expect to see in Socrates’ philosophizing.  The beautiful rural scenery inspires Socrates to craft a pair of speeches on the topic of erotic love, demonstrating how speeches crafted with the study of rhetoric pale in comparison to one composed with philosophical knowledge. Socrates explains to Phaedrus how a philosophical understanding of truth and the nature of the human soul is indispensable to powerful speech crafting, and rhetoric’s total subordination to philosophical study. Therefore, Phaedrus’ love for oratory should instead be shifted to a passionate for philosophy</p>

     <h2 id="Cratylus">Cratylus</h2>
       <h3>Big Questions: What is Language?</h3>
    <p>The dialogue begins with Socrates walking in on an argument between his close friend Hermogenes and a man named Cratylus. The topic of the argument concerns the nature of language, specifically the etymology of names. Hermogenes holds a conventionalist position on names – the name for any given thing is simply what a community of speakers has decided to call it. Conversely, Cratylus maintains a strictly naturalist position on language, claiming that the ‘proper’ name for a thing is intrinsically connected to it and describes its true nature. Socrates joins the conversation and examines each position in turn, trying to resolve the conflicting views. A significant portion of the text is devoted to Socrates offering his own etymological theories, such as the origin of the names of the Gods. In the end, much like in other dialogues which feature a non-philosophical study, Socrates forsakes etymology – rather than giving one insight into the fundamental nature of things by analyzing their names, it merely reveals how those who first created a word chose to describe a given thing. Therefore, etymology is inferior to the process of directly looking into the essence of things in themselves, which of course is done through the practice of philosophy.</p>
