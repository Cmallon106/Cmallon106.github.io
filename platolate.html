        <p>The late dialogues show Plato in peak philosophical form, boasting his most lengthy and complex discourses on various high-minded philosophical issues. Long gone is the time of the Socratic Dialogues, represented by Socrates' secondary role in the ensuing discussions, or even his complete absence. Plato's late dialogues also involve the most explicit cross-referencing between them, with many discussions involving the same characters and taking place on successive days. Plato used his last works to turn back to the ideas he had spent so much time etablishing, and subject them to the rigorous analysis which has always characterized his philosophical work. Though nearing the end of his life, Plato's late dialogues illustrate a mind that remained as sharp and subtle as ever before.</p>

    <h3>Big Questions: What is The Origin of The World?</h3>
    <p>Set after the discussion presented in the <i>Republic</i>, <i>Timaeus</i> counts among work such as <i>Apology</i> and <i>Menexenus</i> in that it is a dialogue with almost no actual dialogue. Aside from a brief introductory conversation with Socrates, the bulk of the text is dedicated to a monologue by the (most likely fabricated) title character Timaeus. In a dazzling, rhetorically elaborate speech, Timaeus employs Platonic ideas such as that of the Forms to theorize about the creation of the world. Timaeus develops the division between the abstract, eternal world of Forms and the sensible, physical world, and explains the relationship between the two. In order to explain how the physical world comes to ‘reflect’ the abstract world, Timaeus posits a creator deity he calls the <i>Demiurge</i> (Greek for ‘craftsman'), who uses the Forms as templates to shape the material world. Emphasizing the role of mathematical harmony in the cosmic order, Timaeus sets the foundations of the sciences, and finishes with an analysis of the illnesses and subsequent treatments of the soul. <i>Timaeus</i> was one of the central texts of Platonism in both Antiquity and the Middle Ages, and the source of much metaphysical and theological controversy. Readers should always be weary of attributing the theories presented in the dialogues to Plato’s own opinions, and this caution should be maintained while reading <i>Timaeus</i> above all. In the dialogue itself Timaeus warns that, due to the great distance, both literal and metaphorical, between us and the heavens, any account of them will not be the whole truth. The tension between what is to be taken as sincere philosophical conviction, and what is meant to be poetic embellishment, is part of the richness and lively debate that surrounds Plato’s work to this day.</p>

        <h2 id="Critias">Critias</h2>
    <p>Paired with <i>Timaeus</i>, <i>Critias</i> is the second installment of what scholars believe would have been a trilogy of dialogues set shortly after the <i>Republic</i>. Would have, because <i>Critias</i> as we know it today is only a fragment of the entire work, and the third discussion implied by the text was either never written or else lost to time. From the beginning of <i>Timaeus</i> we know that Socrates had engaged Timaeus, Critias, and Hermocrates in an explanation of yesterday's conversation about an ideal city. Socrates is disappointed, however, that the conversation was only a ‘technical’ description, and desires a more satisfying account of such a state in action. The trio of discussants agree to oblige Socrates, beginning with Timaeus and moving on to Critias. <i>Critias</i> is a recitation of an old tale he had heard about ancient Athens in Egypt. The story describes historical Athens as a state very similar to the ideal one described in <i>Republic</i>, and is compared against the fabled city of Atlantis. The Atlanteans, said to be the children of Poseidon, were a technologically advanced civilization from a large island in the Atlantic Ocean, and had conquered the known world up to Italy in Europe and as far as Egypt in Africa. Atlantis serves as a corrupt foil to the virtuous and freedom-loving Athenians, who courageously beat the invaders back from the Mediterranean. Zeus, seeing the wickedness of the Atlanteans, gathers the gods together to pass judgement on them; but it is here that the dialogue cuts off, and what he says we will never know.</p>

        <h2 id="Parmenides">Parmenides</h2>
    <h3>Big Questions: What is The One?</h3>
    <p>Widely considered to be one of Plato’s most dense and challenging works, <i>Parmenides</i> claims to be the account of a conversation between the great philosophers Parmenides and Zeno of Elea, along with a young Socrates. The occasion for the discussion was a reading, given by Zeno, of his treatise defending Parmenides’ monism (the idea that the world is fundamentally comprised of a single essence or substance). The first half of the conversation involves Socrates offering a rudimentary theory of the Forms to counter one of Zeno’s arguments – if things are many, things would simultaneously be both like and unlike, which is impossible. The Forms remove this worry, since it is possible for sensible things to partake in many Forms simultaneously, including the Forms of Like and Unlike. Parmenides takes over the conversation and offers several problems for the theory of Forms, such as determining the limit of what there are Forms of, and explaining how exactly sensibles come to ‘partake’ in a Form. Socrates has no answer to these problems, but Parmenides appears to still favor the idea of Forms, and has faith that as Socrates grows older he will become properly exercised in philosophical work such that he can face these challenges. The second half of the discussion, taken up between Parmenides and Aristotle (not the famous student of Plato), demonstrates exactly the kind of philosophical work just described; what follows is a relentlessly complex and subtle chain of arguments about the possible natures of The One, as well as their implications. <i>Parmenides</i> is told in a way unprecedented among Plato’s corpus, in that the content of the text is three times removed from the actual conversation– the account we read is related by Cephalus, who is reporting what was said by Antiphon, who himself is reporting what was told to him by Pythodorus. Such great distance between us and the discussants of <I>Parmenides</I> seems to accentuate the apparent impenetrability of the text, and speak to the incredible depth and importance of the arguments contained therein.</p>

        <h2 id="Theaetetus">Theaetetus</h2>
    <h3>Big Questions: What is Knowledge?</h3>
    <p>Though prior dialogues have touched on questions about knowledge, <i>Theaetetus</i> is the only one among them to make a deep, persistent inquiry into the question of what knowledge fundamentally is. As such, it is a foundational text to the field of epistemology, the study of the nature and validity of knowledge. Theaetetus was a famous mathematician and close associate of Plato’s for many years, and this dialogue seems to be a work dedicated to him shortly after his death in 369 B.C. Therefore, we can confidently date <i>Theaetetus</i> among the last works Plato ever produced. Befitting its place among the Late Period dialogues, Theaetetus presents us with a long, complex exercise in philosophical investigation, with Socrates taking a more auxiliary position to other speakers. As opposed to the earlier ‘Socratic’ dialogues of the Early and Middle Periods, Socrates describes his role as that of a ‘midwife,’ helping bright young men develop and test out their own ideas and arguments. Socrates works through successive theories of knowledge with Theaetetus, connecting them with other ideas such as Protagoras’ famous ‘man is the measure’ concept of relative truth, and testing them all independently. The rigorous, systematic method of logically testing ideas before committing to them is also found in the preceding dialogue <i>Parmenides</i>, and will be carried on in <i>Sophist</i> and <i>Statesman</i>, which are combined with <i>Theaetetus</i> to make a contiguous trilogy.</p>

    <h3>Big Questions: What is Sophistry?</h3>
    <p>Following the prior day’s conversation in <i>Theaetetus</i>, the geometer Theodorus invites a philosopher visiting from Elea to partake in further discussion with his two young pupils and Socrates. Socrates asks the Visitor if it is true that he and the other philosophers from Elea (such as Parmenides and Zeno, who featured in <i>Parmenides</i>) consider the sophist, the statesman, and the philosopher to fundamentally be one and the same sort of person. What follows are two complex conversations in which the Visitor illustrates his understanding of the sophist and statesman, each transcribed in the dialogue of the same name. The first conversation, despite being initiated by Socrates, is taken up between the Visitor and Theaetetus. Despite occasional reference to the need for one, no conversation about the nature of the philosopher ever occurs. In the process of defining ‘the sophist,’ the Visitor employs a method similar to the one described in <i>Phaedrus</i> to logically divide and organize the different aspects of sophistry. In this case he offers several different classes of sophistry, all bound by a set of distinct qualities – the selling of alleged knowledge about virtue to wealthy young men, expertise in winning debates, cleansing people’s souls by refuting their false beliefs, and so on. The final reckoning of the sophist, according to the Visitor, is that the practice of sophistry is an ‘imitation art,’ in that the sophist merely produces inadequate ‘copies’ of the truth, which he makes appear like real wisdom to the ignorant.</p>

        <h2 id="Statesman">Statesman</h2>
    <h3>Big Questions: What is Statesmanship?</h3>
    <p><i>Statesman</i> is a sequel to <i>Sophist</i>, and continues the unnamed Visitor’s project of describing the natures of sophistry and statesmanship. In this dialogue, he shifts discussion partners to the other young man present, the other pupil of Theodorus who is also named Socrates. From the outset, it is to be understood that a ‘statesman,’ or <i>politikos</i>, is not merely the person who has been designated as ruler in a city; a statesman is a specialist, like a doctor or mathematician, who possesses expert knowledge of how to rule justly. Therefore, is important to keep in mind that the Visitor is not speaking about any particular ruler at the time, or making any claim about specific political policies – his chief concern (like in <i>Sophist</i>) is to demonstrate to his young discussion partner the ‘method of division’ he uses to organize and clarify things under philosophical investigation. Lengthy parts of the dialogue are dedicated to the Visitor expounding on the practice of dividing and subdividing classes of things by ‘carving at the joints’ of their natures, rather than in arbitrary or conventional ways. The visitor concludes that no city in Greece is currently ruled by a true statesman, and that in fact they would be better off being led by sophists. This is because, though sophists only pretend to possess true insight, their policies would still at least weakly reflect the real thing, even though there is no true knowledge of ruling to be found anywhere in the city.</p>

        <h2 id="Philebus">Philebus</h2>
    <h3>Big Questions: What is The Good Life?</h3>
    <p>Among the last works ever written by Plato, <i>Philebus</i> offers us one last look at the Socrates of earlier periods; standing center stage in the discussion, delighting in examining the opinions of clever, handsome young men. Unlike the Socrates of the past, this Socrates is very sure of himself, ready to discourse at length on complex metaphysical questions and give his own account of what constitutes the best human life. The dialogue picks up in the middle of the conversation, just as a youth named Protarchus is taking over for Philebus. We learn that Philebus had maintained the position that the best life is one which is maximally pleasurable, and he and Socrates had failed to reach a consensus on the issue. Surprisingly, Socrates’ conclusion is not that the good life is to be found in wisdom, but in a proper mix of wisdom and pleasure. He arrives at this conclusion through a lengthy process (the same one demonstrated in <i>Sophist</i>/<i>Statesman</i>) of dividing and examining the varieties of pleasure and knowledge, as well as their subsequent value to a person. The dialogue ends the same way it begins, with Protarchus unsatisfied by Socrates’ account and wishing to discuss it further. Whatever problems he wished to continue working at, we will never find out.</p>

        <h2 id="Laws">Laws</h2>
    <h3>Big Questions: What is the Constitution of an Ideal City?</h3>
    <p>The last and longest work Plato ever wrote, <i>Laws</i> was left unpublished at his death. It is said that Plato felt it still needed revision, though the text as we have it today appears entirely complete. The dialogue follows three elderly men – Clinias of Crete, Megillus of Sparta, and an unnamed Athenian – on their journey to the shrine at Zeus’ birthplace on Mount Ida. The Athenian strikes up a conversation about the purpose of the ‘laws and constitutions’ which govern his friends’ cities; namely, their focus on the practice and conduct of war. What follows is a discussion about the goals of civic institutions, and the need for laws to promote the development of citizens’ virtue in peacetime as well as war. At the end of book III, Clinias reveals that he is one of ten commissioners tasked with establishing a new city on Crete, and the conversation shifts to the Athenian giving Clinias advice on the construction of said city. The rest of the text is devoted to a detailed philosophical treatment of laws which should be set out – from family law, to criminal law, to trade, to education – in order to ensure the flourishing of virtue in its free, self-governing citizens. Among the ideas examined in the dialogue, the discussants consider the justification and use of punishment in the enforcement of law, as well as engage in an elaborate argument to prove the existence of the Gods to justify laws which forbid impiety. It is still a matter of debate whether the constitution and policies proposed in <i>Laws</i> are meant to criticize, or even replace, those illustrated in the <i>Republic</i>. It is possible that, while <i>Republic</i> (and to some extent <i>Statesman</i>) are purely theoretical investigations into political theory, <i>Laws</i> is meant to supplement such investigation with more practical considerations.</p>
