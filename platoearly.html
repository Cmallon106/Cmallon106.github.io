    <p>Plato's early works are known as the 'Socratic Dialogues,' named so for Socrate's central role in almost every discussion. It is thought that many of the arguments that are given in Plato's early dialogues closely resemble the historical Socrates' actual thinking, rather than Plato simply using his likeness as a mouthpiece. Consequently, Socrates' early philosphical investigations are generally more shorter and more limited in scope,  mostly conisting in Socrates analyzing other speaker's thoughts rather than presenting his own. It is in these dialogues that we first experience the rigorous, question-and-answer discussion format which epitomizes the Socratic search for truth, and watch Socrates plant the seeds of ideas which will be richly devloped in later dialogues.</p>

    <h3>Big Questions: What is Piety?</h3>
    <p>In the central marketplace of Athens stands the offices of the magistrate responsible for legal cases potentially incurring the displeasure of the Gods. It is outside of these offices that Socrates, on his way to answer charges of impiety brought against him by his fellow citizen Meletus, meets a man named Euthyphro. Euthyphro explains that he is there to bring charges against his own father for the death of his father's servant. Socrates fears that the Gods will look down on an action as impious as testifying against one's own father, but Euthyphro is confident he knows what actions are pious or not. The ensuing conversation revolves around a simple question which Euthyphro, for all of his posturing, cannot answer; What is the nature of Piety itself? This dialogue sets the tone for what many others will be about, namely Socrates’ pursuit of a single, consistent, universally applicable standard or definition for whatever is being discussed. Along with Socrates’ insistence that he possesses no knowledge about the issue himself, <i>Euthyphro</i> sets an early example for the dialectical process of humbly working towards truth through the use of dispassionate reason.</p>

    <h3>Big Questions: What is Piety? What is The Good Life?</h3>
    <p>Except for a short interlude in which Socrates engages one of his accusers in discussion, the <i>Apology</i> is not so much a dialogue. Rather, the pages of this work are mostly taken up by a speech, given by Socrates, to justify himself to a jury of his fellow citizens on charges of offending the Gods through his philosophical practice. More than just a defense of Socrates the man, Plato uses the <i>Apology</i> to defend the study of philosophy as a whole. In his speech, Socrates explains his devotion to philosophy and his unwavering pursuit of the Truth, taken up with select young men and prominent thinkers across Athens. Socrates passionately argues that, rather than offending the Gods in his inquiries, he is actually showing the utmost devotion to them by doggedly pursuing wisdom wherever it may be found, particularly wisdom which pertains to virtue and goodness. The speech at his trial is Socrates’ last philosophical admonition to the people of Athens; for the sake of their souls, use reason to think honestly and dispassionately, and decide for themselves whether the charges against him have any truth. In the light of his eventual condemnation and execution, the Apology seems to illuminate to us just who the guilty party truly was in the end.</p>

    <h3>Big Questions: What Justice?</h3>
    <p>Taking place after his condemnation by his fellow citizens, <i>Crito</i> shows us Socrates’ last days in prison before his execution. Crito, Socrates’ friend and the namesake of the dialogue, comes to him the day before his execution in a last-ditch effort to persuade him to allow his friends to smuggle him out of the city and save his life. True to his nature, Socrates rejects this plan on the grounds that, by avoiding the punishment dictated to him by law, he would be committing a grave injustice. Crito and Socrates then engage in a hurried debate about the justice of Socrates’ staying or escaping; Crito raises concern over Socrates abandoning his friends, as well as leaving his children fatherless. Further, he claims that is it actually unjust for Socrates to meekly stay and let his enemies, who have unjustly sentenced him to death, triumph in wronging him (and philosophy as a whole) by executing him. Socrates ignores the worry about his friends and children, maintaining that an absolute devotion to virtue should be kept above any personal concern. Socrates explains that, given the freedoms and benefits he has enjoyed through his whole life under the Athenian State, he is obligated to respect its rules and decisions even beyond that of his own parents. It is here that Socrates articulates one of the first examples of the Social Contract – by living his life under Athenian Law, he has implicitly agreed to all of the rules and punishments it dictates. Thus, it would be grossly unjust to forsake his end of the bargain just because he now faces the raw end of the deal.</p>

        <h2 id="Ion">Ion</h2>
    <h3>Big Questions: What is Poetry?</h3>
    <p>This short dialogue takes place when Socrates bumps into Ion, a young rhapsode who had just one first place in a competition reciting the poetry of Homer. It is quickly demonstrated that Ion, like all of the other poets and actors of Greece, possess no real knowledge of anything he talks about in his work – a conclusion which Ion ironically accepts. The dialogue’s tongue-in-cheek humor at the expense of Ion sets a precedent for what will be Socrates’(or Plato's) longstanding antagonism toward poets and rhetoricians; even as far back as legendary writers like Homer or Hesiod, it is not through wisdom or mastery of a topic that a poet can produce great work. Rather, it is only when one has been ‘divinely inspired’ that any of them seem to be able to discourse on such important and complex topics as morality, politics, piety, and so on. In other words, as Socrates puts it, “As long as a human being has his intellect in his possession, he will always lack the power to make poetry or sing prophecy.”</p>

        <h2 id="Laches">Laches</h2>
    <h3>Big Questions: What is Courage?</h3>
    <p>For modern English-speaking readers, <i>Laches</i> as a dialogue investigates the nature of Courage. However, the subject matter which Socrates and his distinguished discussion partners take up is much more complicated than that. In Greek this concept is known as <i>andreia</i>, more closely rendered as ‘manliness,’ which covers a whole range of brave, active, leader-like qualities expected of all ‘true’ men. It is therefore quite fitting that the two other main speakers in the discussion are Laches and Nicias, respected old generals who served nobly in the Peloponnesian War. Thus, it is only natural that the ‘traditional’ understanding of courage is delivered by these two venerable men (as well as two other men present who are the sons of respected statesmen, Lysimachus and Melesias). Naturally, this traditional notion of courage dissatisfies Socrates, and the group pursues a more tenable definition. Though Nicias’ theory of courage – that it is a kind of wisdom in regards to what should be feared or not – is one which Socrates seems to take up in later dialogues, several difficulties for such a position are found, and the discussion breaks off not long after.</p>

        <h2 id="Lysis">Lysis</h2>
    <h3>Big Questions: What is Friendship?</h3>
    <p>As usual, Socrates is spending his time around the Lyceum, a popular gymnasium in the city where men of all ages may exercise and socialize. It is here that Socrates encounters Hippothales, a young man infatuated with another youth named Lysis. The other young men are bored to death by Hippothales’ endless praise for Lysis, so Socrates agrees to demonstrate how to properly draw a lover’s interest – thoughtful philosophical discussion. Socrates engages Lysis and his friend Menexenus (who will later become a close associate of Socrates) about the nature of friendship; who or what is a friend to who (or what) else, and on what grounds? The notion of ‘friendship’ discussed here is a bit broader than we would understand friendship to be today – the Greek word for love, <i>philein</i>, is synonymous with the word for friendship, <i>philia</i>, and encompasses family relationships, platonic friendships, as well as romantic relationships. In short, Socrates and the boys seek to understand the nature of kinship in all of its many forms. Socrates leads the pair through several contradictory definitions of friendship given to us by traditional wisdom, such as like being friend to the like, like things naturally opposing each other, opposites attracting, and so on. The goal of this dialogue doesn’t seem to lie in finding an actual answer to these questions, but rather in Socrates displaying the practice of philosophical problem-solving to the young friends, and showing them just how deep and complex the relationship they have with each other is.</p>

        <h2 id="Menexenus">Menexenus</h2>
    <p><i>Menexenus</i> is somewhat unique among the dialogues in that it is not entirely clear what Plato’s intent in writing it was. The dialogue is short and straightforward; Socrates bumps into Menexenus (the very same who Socrates discoursed with in <i>Lysis</i>) and strikes up a conversation. Menexenus informs Socrates that the Council of Athens is looking for someone to deliver the eulogy for soldiers who had recently fallen in battle, but he fears that there is no one skilled enough to deliver a proper speech. Socrates exclaims that such a speech should be easy to deliver, and that even he could, since he has received instruction by Aspasia, the mistress of the famous orator Pericles. Socrates claims that it was actually Aspasia who taught Pericles everything he knew, and proceeds to launch into a lengthy eulogy for the city of Athens itself. Socrates’ monologue takes up the majority of the ‘dialogue,’ with almost no discourse between him and Menexenus. It has been proposed that Socrates’ speech is meant to satirize the verbosity and selective praise common in popular speeches, being more concerned with flattery than honesty. Likewise, it may be that the speech demonstrates the superior oratorical skill of a philosopher as compared to any of the supposed ‘expert’ rhetoricians of the time.</p>

        <h2 id="Protagoras">Protagoras</h2>
    <h3>Big Questions: What is Virtue? What is Knowledge?</h3>
    <p>In this dramatic dialogue, Socrates accompanies his young friend Hippocrates to see Protagoras, a renowned travelling teacher. Protagoras is a member of a class of iterant teachers, or sophists, who claimed that they could teach eager young men across Greece the ‘art of citizenship’ for a price. As will be seen in other dialogues, Socrates (or Plato speaking as Socrates) is critical of the sophists, who he sees as peddlers of crowd-pleasing rhetorical tricks rather than true wisdom. That being said, Protagoras is shown to be much less of a crank than others in his profession, putting forward an inspiring appeal to the study of virtue. <i>Protagoras</i> fundamentally revolves around the question of whether true virtue can be taught, or if it is an innate part of a person’s character. Socrates initially raises doubts about this, but Protagoras insists he can teach them to anyone. This dialogue is somewhat unique in that both sides of the ensuing debate are ultimately found wanting; Protagoras’ insistence that virtues such as courage are not a kind of wisdom is refuted, while Socrates’ position that virtue may not be teachable is likewise found wanting. The Socrates of this dialogue is also different from other Early Period dialogues in that, rather than teasing out another person’s opinion and dissecting it, he brings his own convictions to the table for analysis. Though in the end, even if Socrates himself cannot fully answer the question of virtue’s teachability, he amply proves that Protagoras and the other sophists should certainly not be entrusted to teach it.</p>

        <h2 id="Euthydemus">Euthydemus</h2>
    <h3>Big Questions: What is Wisdom? What is Virtue?</h3>
    <p> <i>Euthydemus</i> kicks off with Socrates bumping into his old friend Crito and telling him about an encounter he had with a pair of sophists just the other day. The pair advertised themselves spectacularly, claiming the power to defend or refute any argument whatever, be it true or false.  Despite Crito’s reservations, Socrates urges him to accompany him in enrolling under the sophists’ tutelage. Like other dialogues involving sophists, Socrates engages the brothers Euthydemus and Dionysodorus to demonstrate their incredible gift of teaching, imploring them to persuade the young boy Clinias to devote himself to the ‘study and practice of virtue.’ The two brothers employ what Plato defines as ‘eristic’ arguments; arguments that focus on frustrating one’s opponent and winning the debate, rather than earnestly working towards the truth of a given matter. These weaselly logic-traps are contrasted against Socrates’ method of argumentation; asking honest questions and critically evaluating ideas in a cooperative pursuit of truth. Despite the ironic twist to Socrates’ drawn-out praise for the sophists’ ‘teaching,’ the dialogue ends without the two brothers’ arguments being completely dismissed - Socrates (and by extension Plato) seems to think that any attempted use of reason deserves to be respectfully considered and analyzed, even if one does not accept its conclusions in the end.</p>

        <h2 id="Charmides">Charmides</h2>
    <h3>Big Questions: What is Temperance?</h3>
    <p>Much like <i>Laches</i>, the topic of discussion in <i>Charmides</i> is hard to translate out of Greek, particularly Ancient Greek, context. Most often rendered as ‘temperance’ or ‘restraint’ in English, the issue being discussed between Socrates and the handsome youth Charmides is the trait of <i>sophrosyne</i>; well-developed understanding of oneself, one’s duty to others (such as self-restraint and proper respect), and right behavior in regards to one’s ambition and social standing. For a bright young aristocrat like Charmides, cultivating such a quality is indispensable as a pursuit, which Socrates is more than happy to join him in. It is also important that modern readers understand the historical context in which the dialogue takes place - Charmides, as well as his guardian Critias, would become notorious for his involvement with the Thirty Tyrants, a cabal of antidemocratic noblemen appointed by the king of Sparta to rule Athens after its defeat in the Peloponnesian War. Charmides and Critias would in fact be killed amid the fighting which overthrew the Tyrants and restored democracy to Athens. Ancient readers would be acutely aware of this dark history, giving a layer of complexity to Charmides that is absent from the attractive but one-dimensional young men Socrates usually discourses with. As far as the discussion itself goes, Charmides produces three successive accounts of ‘temperance,’ the last being one he learned from Critias – to possess ‘temperance’ is simply to ‘mind one’s own business’ and behave according to one’s rank. Critias himself steps in to defend this position, but ultimately fails to defend his definition from Socrates’ persistent questioning. From there, the dialogue breaks off in a characteristically open-ended state of befuddlement.</p>
