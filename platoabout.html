<h2>About</h2>

<h3>Who Was Plato?</h3>
    <p>Plato was an Athenian philosopher who lived and wrote during the Classical Period of Ancient Greece. Born sometime between 429 and 423 BC, Plato came from a wealthy and aristocratic background. As a young man, he came under the study of Socrates, who would go on to appear as the central character in so many of his Dialogues. Following Socrates’ death around 399, Plato went on to establish his own center of higher learning on the outskirts of Athens, in the sacred grove of Academus. Plato’s Academy served as an epicenter of political, mathematical, and philosophical study for the Hellenistic world until it was reduced to rubble by the Roman general Sulla in 86 AD. Until his death around 347, Plato expounded on the work of his old mentor as well as struck out on his own in bold new avenues of thought. Combined with his equally famous student Aristotle, Plato’s ideas would grow to form the roots of Western philosophy, profoundly influencing many branches of study – theology, epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, and political philosophy to name a few - to this day.</p>

<h3>The Platonic Dialogue</h3>
    <p>While other intellectuals of the day expressed their ideas in poetic meter or prose essays, Plato shared his in the form of dialogues. From Socrates, Plato inherited a love for active, face-to-face discussion of philosophical issues. Unlike his master however, Plato trusted the written word, and penned several dozen works over the course of his life. Of the roughly 40+ writings which have survived from antiquity to the present day, almost half are only dubiously attributed to Plato himself, or are otherwise thought to be created by a student or associate of his.</p>
    
    <p>Plato’s dialogues take the form of question-and-answer conversations, led by a knowledgeable facilitator, between a small group of participants. Besides being a novel way to transmit ideas, the dialogue format itself is an expression of Plato’s thinking. The dialogue represented a stark contrast to the way ideas and policies were deliberated in mainstream Athenian society. On one hand, glory-seeking professional teachers travelled between cities, charging a modest sum to hand their 'widom' down to the eager young men which flocked to them; On the other, public forums filled with loud, dramatic speeches, where complex issues were decided by brute majority opinion. The dialogue serves as an intimate intellectual exercise, in which a specific issue is earnestly and rationally deliberated on from multiple angles. Socrates’ humble, open-minded attitude toward teaching and investigating is reflected in Plato’s writing. Through the dialogue form, readers are invited to participate in the discussion right alongside its characters. Nowhere does Plato step out from behind the curtain and declare the 'correct' interpretation of the issue being discussed; he certainly puts the views he favors in the spotlight, but ultimately it is up the reader to digest the issue at hand for themself and draw their own conclusions.</p>

<h3>The Platonic ‘Canon’</h3> 
    <p>Broadly, there are two schools of thought when it comes to organizing Plato’s dialogues; a Chronological grouping which attempts to order them by estimated time of composition, and a Thematic order which pairs dialogues by their philosophical content. I have attempted to synthesize both approaches with the organization of this site, using the former system informed by the latter. Of course it is the case that we don’t know for certain when and in what order the dialogues were written, and it is true that a chronological grouping will possess inconsistencies in regards to individual dialogues. But despite that, I still believe that a roughly chronological grouping of Plato’s work is the most useful for the purposes of this site, especially when dealing with Plato's work in bulk. In my opinion, a purely thematic system results in an unwieldy number of groups that are somewhat scattered in regards to their length and complexity. For example, the very first system for organizing Plato’s work comes to us from Thrasyllus in the first century A.D., who arranged the dialogues into nine different groups of four works each, plus a separate group for the 'spurious” works.' Arranging the selected dialogues into Early, Middle, and Late periods divides them into large but manageable chunks, making the presentation of them much more efficient. Likewise, such an order illustrates the general progress of the dialogue’s content, from merely posing questions with no firm answer to putting forward full-fledged theories.</p> 
    
    <p>I have also decided to leave out the spurious works in Plato’s Canon. Being an index for Plato’s work, I want users to receive work that is unquestionably Plato’s. The other writings are certainly valuable for a better understanding of the Platonist tradition as a whole, but I believe they are ultimately not necessary to develop a firm grasp on Plato’s philosophy. I wish to balance the desire to provide as wide a selection of Plato’s work as possible with the need to keep the site a manageable size. I hope this webpage can serve as a useful pedagogical tool, as well as a database for anyone interested in understanding theories and ideas which are foundational to the study of Western philosophy.<p/>
